This allows him to provide a more comprehensive approach to fitness, taking into account not just the physical aspects of training, but also the neurological aspects. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just starting out on your fitness journey, this conversation is sure to provide valuable insights and actionable tips to help you reach your fitness goals. So sit back, relax, and enjoy this conversation with Jeff Cavaliere. If you want to dive even deeper into the information discussed in this episode, you can go to athleanx.com, where you'll find some of Jeff's programs. You can also find him at Athlean-X on YouTube and @athleanx on Instagram. The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements. We've done that for several reasons. First of all, the quality of their supplements is exceedingly high. Second of all, we wanted to have a location where you could find all of the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast in one easy to find place. You can now find that place at livemomentous.com/huberman. In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally, something that a lot of other supplement companies simply do not do. So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US, or you live abroad. Right now, not all of the supplements that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed, but that catalog of supplements is being expanded very rapidly, and a good number of them, some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there. Again, you can find them at livemomentous.com/huberman. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1. I started taking AG1 way back in 2012. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason that I started taking AG1, and the reason I still take AG1 twice a day, is that it covers all of my foundational health needs for mental health, physical health, and performance. As I mentioned earlier, it has vitamins and minerals that cover any deficiencies I might have in my diet. It also has probiotics, and the probiotics are key for supporting the so-called gut microbiome. The gut microbiome are trillions of little microbacteria that live in our gut from our throat all the way down to the base of our gut, that support everything from our immune system to our hormone health, to the so-called gut brain axis. That is, our gut and our brain are in direct communication with one another in ways that support our mood, our ability to think, and overall brain health. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs, which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3+K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are essential for an enormous number of processes in our body, from immune system health to hormone balance to mood. So, there's a great offer if you're interested in Athletic Greens. Our second sponsor is Perpetual Run, which is an advanced run training methodology. They believe in running efficiently, running intelligently, and using science to get you faster. I started working with Perpetual Run a couple of years ago. I had been coaching high-level athletes for years, and I wanted to be able to support them with cutting-edge methods and training protocols. So I reached out to Perpetual Run and started working with them. I found their methodology to be highly effective, and it has really supported the performance of my athletes. So, if you're interested in enhancing your running performance and improving your running efficiency, you can go to perpetualrun.com/huberman to learn more. And our third sponsor is Uptime Supplements. I started taking Uptime Supplements because they are based on my research at Stanford on aging and how to prevent the diseases of aging. So they are providing me with high quality supplements that support the biological pathways of health and wellness. Uptime Supplements also offer some fantastic supplements for women's health and sexual health. If you're interested in Uptime Supplements, you can go to uptimesupplements.com/huberman. With that, let's dive into our conversation with Jeff Cavaliere. So, Jeff, what do you recommend for beginners in terms of a training split between strength and endurance? Well, I would recommend that beginners focus primarily on strength training for the first four to six weeks. This will help establish a strong foundation for overall fitness and provide the necessary building blocks for muscle growth. Once that foundation is established, you can begin to incorporate endurance training. For beginners, I would recommend two days of strength training per week, with rest days in between. For endurance training, I would recommend incorporating cardio workouts once or twice a week, along with some higher intensity strength training exercises to ensure that your body adapts to both types of training. How do you recommend integrating strength and endurance training into an overall fitness program? To effectively integrate strength and endurance training, you should perform strength training exercises that target all major muscle groups, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. These exercises will help you develop the strength needed for endurance activities, like running or cycling. Additionally, incorporating some form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or high-intensity strength training (HISS) into your routine can help improve your endurance and strength at the same time. For example, you could do a series of sprints, followed by a higher intensity strength exercise like a pull-up, to create a well-rounded workout that combines both strength and endurance training. What are your recommendations for stretching during a workout or warm-up routine? My recommendation for stretching is to incorporate it into your workout routine or warm-up routine rather than focusing solely on it as a standalone exercise. Static stretching is great for increasing flexibility and preventing injury, but it should be combined with dynamic stretching exercises that actively lengthen your muscles and joints. These exercises should be performed after a workout or warm-up routine to promote relaxation and recovery. For example,'
